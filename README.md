This repository is my personal endeavor to familiarize myself with The Composable Architecture and grasp a couple of basic examples. It is a library designed for building scalable applications with a focus on composition, testing, and ergonomics. The library can be utilized in SwiftUI, UIKit, and more, spanning across any Apple platform.

The project comprises two chapters based on the official TCA tutorials, which can be found [here](https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/tutorials/meetcomposablearchitecture/).
